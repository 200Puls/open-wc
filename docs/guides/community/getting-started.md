In the Web Components Ecosystem there are many different base and component libraries.
Depending on your requirements one might be more appropriate for your project than others.

If you want to build new component be sure to check out all [Base Libraries](./base-libraries.md).
If you want to use existing components then take a look at the [Component Libraries](./component-libraries.md).

There are also different Web Component Communities. Most of them are centered around a specific Base or Component Library.

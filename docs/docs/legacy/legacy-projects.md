# Legacy >> Legacy Projects || 10

Over the last years we have created different projects and recommendations. During this time certain projects have become deprecated as we moved on to different tools or approaches.

This doesn't mean that we've completely dropped support for these projects. While we don't feature them on the main website, we still maintain and support these projects. We don't develop any new features or functionalities, but we will continue to support bugfixes and in some cases update along with the dependent tooling.

The documentation for our legacy projects is maintained in the github readmes:
